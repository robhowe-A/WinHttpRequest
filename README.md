# HttpRequest  
This repository stores a windows application project (Desktop + .NET + C#). The application, called Http Request, provides a gui means of sending http requests and displaying the response data in useful ways. The public (instead of private) nature of this repository is to allow for a showcase of my development ability. It is not for software distribution. It is for exploring, reading, or learning from. To that extent, this repository will not include the future application's full source code. It is, however, a starting point. The current application is in the releases for executable download.

##  Where do I begin?  

1. First, install the application [here](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P1X1ZPKMTLN?hl=en-us&gl=US&ocid=pdpshare)  
2. The app resides in the start menu apps list  
3. Click "HTTP Request" to open the app  
4. That's it! You now have v1 application skipping the need to build and publish.  

- The solution files were created in visual studio 2022.  
- An executable of the application is made up of the current alpha release. Just click on the release tag on the code directory page to go to the application download location.  
- It's target is for Windows x64 desktop.  

Http Request is a working tool, not an attractive or refined display product. The styling is basic and default in many elements. Developed in Forms style, this app is responsive on windows desktops - it expands or collapses menus on request/need - and dynamically adapts its controls based on different situations of request submission. I've tested the app and am happy with 1920 x 1920 max dimensions. It is useful with different data in different sizes, both large or small. Also, Forms seems to fit that.

## How to use the application  
Enter any url and select a method for the request. The default is a GET request. Use the options or change the input parameters for your requests. Some functionality is for development purposes and may not function.  

## Privacy Policy
This app does not collect PII data or any records to identify a purchaser individual. Collected information is anonymous and to be used for software improvement.
